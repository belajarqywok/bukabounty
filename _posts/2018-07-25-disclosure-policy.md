- Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we’ll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.

- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third–party.

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.
